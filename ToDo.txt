Questions:
1) Currently, the materials for the fiber are core=PMMA, Clad1=PolyEthylene1, 
Clad2=PolyEthylene2.  This was taken from the LXe Geant4 example. The data sheet from 
Kuraray showed core=PS, Clad1=PMMA, Clad2=FP.  Jed simply changed the indexes of 
refraction to match the Kuraray data sheet.  Is there a reason to change the materials to
match the data sheet, or is index of refraction the only important property? If we change 
them, what should be used for the FP (Florinated Polymer)?  If we leave it, will this 
cause confusion later on (i.e. will we have to explain to 50 different people why the 
index of refraction is all that matters)?
