Runs were done using the "tent" geometry from last summer. A beam of 250 nm light was incident on the center of the TPB-coated side of the cell wall. The fiber reflectors and the tent reflector were turned on and off in the different runs. Fibers were embedded in all runs. One million photons were used for each run.

THe fibers used in these runs have an error with their rough surfaces. The trapping effiecieny is lower than it should be (3.4% compared to 5.4%). Additionally, only the portion of the fibers inside the cell wall are used, not the one meter of fiber as in the tests.
